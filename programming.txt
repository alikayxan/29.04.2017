Hello guys!

As a courtesy, I would like to inform you that we are new students in the CodeAcademy Center. We also know it's very close to us.
We need learn, we must learn and so we will learn most popular and useful programming languages. 
Our aims to be the good developer in the end of courses. 
I would like to asking from all of the lecturer and old students that share their knowledges between with us.
